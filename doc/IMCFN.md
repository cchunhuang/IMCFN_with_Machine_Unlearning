# IMCFN.py

## Overview

This script defines the `IMCFN` (Image-based Malware Classification with Feature Networks) class, which implements a detector for malware classification using image-based features and a VGG16 neural network.

## Dependencies

- os
- csv
- numpy
- typing
- malwareDetector.detector
- malwareDetector.config
- malwareDetector.const
- VGG16 (custom module)
- Logger (custom module)
- ImageGenerator (custom module)

## Class: IMCFN

IMCFN inherits from the `detector` class in the malwareDetector module.

### Constructor

```python
def __init__(self, config_path: str = DEFAULT_CONFIG_PATH) -> None
```

Initializes the IMCFN object with the specified configuration path:
- Loads the configuration from the specified path
- Sets up logging
- Creates necessary directories
- Initializes ImageGenerator and VGG16 objects with parameters from the configuration

### Methods

#### `extractFeature(self) -> None`

This method is a placeholder and does not perform any action.

#### `vectorize(self) -> None`

Generates image representations of the input files and prepares labels for classification:
- Retrieves labels for input files and test files (if present)
- Processes labels to ensure 'benignware' always has an index of 0
- Generates images using ImageGenerator
- Stores images and corresponding labels in `self.images`

#### `model(self, training: bool = True) -> Any`

Sets up the VGG16 model and handles training or loading based on the configuration and `training` parameter:

- If `self.config.path.pretrained` is not None:
  - Loads either a pre-trained model (when `self.config.path.pretrained` is `"DEF"`) or a default model based on the configuration.
  - If `training` is True: Loads data, trains the model, and returns training results.
  - If `training` is False: Returns None without further training.

- If `self.config.path.pretrained` is None:
  - Does not load any model.
  - If `training` is True: Proceeds directly to training with the existing model (which must have been loaded in a previous step).
  - If `training` is False: Returns None without any action.

Note: When `self.config.path.pretrained` is None and `training` is True, ensure that a model has been loaded at least once before calling this method.

#### `predict(self, file_path: str = None) -> dict`

Predicts labels for the specified files:
- If `file_path` is None, uses the default path `self.config.path.input_files`
- Retrieves file paths
- Prepares image data
- Uses the VGG16 model to make predictions
- Returns a dictionary of file names and predicted labels

#### `getLabel(self, file_path: str) -> dict`

Retrieves labels for the input files from the specified CSV file.

#### `getFilePath(self, file_path: str) -> list`

Retrieves file paths for the input files from the specified CSV file.

## Key Features

1. **Configuration-based Setup**: Uses a JSON configuration file for flexible setup.
2. **Image-based Malware Classification**: Converts input files to images for classification.
3. **VGG16 Model**: Utilizes a custom VGG16 neural network for classification.
4. **Logging**: Implements comprehensive logging using a custom Logger module.
5. **Flexible Training**: Allows for training with custom datasets and parameters.
6. **Prediction**: Can predict labels for new, unseen samples.
7. **Data Handling**: Processes both input and test files when available.

## Process Flow

1. Initialize IMCFN object with configuration
2. Vectorize input files into image representations
3. Set up and optionally train the VGG16 model
4. Predict labels for new samples

## Usage Example

```python
imcfn = IMCFN("config_origin.json")
imcfn.vectorize()
imcfn.model(True)  # Train the model
results = imcfn.predict()  # Make predictions
```

## Notes

- The `extractFeature` method is currently a placeholder and does not perform any action.
- The class uses a configuration object to store various settings and paths.
- Labels are processed to ensure 'benignware' always has an index of 0.
- The `vectorize` method can optionally save generated images based on the configuration.
- The `model` method's behavior depends on both the `training` parameter and the `self.config.path.pretrained` configuration.
- Test file prediction is automatically performed during training if test files are available.
- Ensure that the configuration file is properly set up before using this class.
- The class relies on custom modules (VGG16, ImageGenerator, and Logger) which should be properly implemented and accessible.
